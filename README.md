# IOT_Project-Sewage_Monitoring_System
This project is made using arduino ide and ESP8266

In this project, we have developed a smart device that can detect when the drainage system becomes clogged, and if the water overflows as a result of the clogging, we'll notify the local government to take appropriate action. 
Furthermore, the drainage system's status may be checked in real-time using the Blynk application. For this project, we have used two sensors - ultrasonic sensor and float sensor, a nodemcu esp8266 board, blynk cloud, Arduino ide, a breadboard, a 5V power supplier, a micro USB to USB cable, and a few connecting wires.
